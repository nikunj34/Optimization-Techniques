Give all constraints in less than equals form, coeffecients of objective function in maximization form.
Name the constraints file "mat.csv", coefficient file as "coef.csv".
Each constraint should be a row of "mat.csv".
eg:   minimize 2x+3y
st:   x+y>=4
      x-y>=20
      x,y>=0
      
coef.csv file -2,-3 as maximize -2x-3y
mat.csv file  -1,-1,-4
              -1,1,-20
              Converting constraints to less than equals form
After running the code you can access "ind", which is the indexes of basic variable, and "ans" which  are their values.
